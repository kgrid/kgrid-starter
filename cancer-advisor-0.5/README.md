## Cancer Advisor

### Developer getting started notes

(See the `/info/README.md` or http://kgrid.org/cancer-advisor/info for end-user demo notes.) 

Cancer Advisor was the first web app developed as a client app for Knowledge Grid. It was first deployed together with the knowledge grid library on DLHS development server.

This updated version uses three risk calculation knowledge objects and three risk score interpretation knowledge objects loaded in the kgird activators.  

The public version of the app is here: http://kgrid.org/cancer-advisor, and is published automatically from `master` in this repo.
